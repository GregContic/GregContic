			<figcaption id="img-caption">She was the town's darling, the daughter of Mexico's then-mayor of Pampanga. She was an ordinary girl who enjoyed makeup, perfumes, dressmaking, and dancing. She was also a title holder. On March 2, 1942, however, makeup turned into weapons, dance turned into combat, and the beauty queen was given a new title: <strong><i>Kumander Liwayway</i></strong></figcaption>

				<div class="divider-2">about</div>
				<p>Remedios Gomez-Paraiso, also known as the Joan of Arc of the Philippines, was a formidable opponent who vowed to exact revenge on the foreign invaders for killing her father. This sparked a fire in her heart and later on, she eventually decided to join Hukbalahap or Hukbong Laban Sa Hapon.</p>

					<div class="divider-2">early life</div>
					<ul>
						<li> She was the daughter of Basilio Gomez, who serves as the mayor of Anao, a provincial town in Pampanga, Philippines.</li>
						<li> As a teenager, she was interested in making dresses and perfume, and often participated in local beauty pageants.</li>
						<li> Before the war, Remedios engages in various small business ventures, including selling rice, baby dresses, and embroideries. She becomes associated with local peasant organizations like the Aguman ding Maldang Talapagobra (AMT), reflecting her commitment to grassroots causes.</li>
						<li> In 1941, the Japanese occupation of the Philippines during World War II begins, drastically altering the course of Remedios's life.</li>
						<li> Tragedy strikes when Remedios's father, Basilio Gomez, is captured by the Japanese. He endures torture and is subsequently executed. This event marks the first World War II fatality in Mexico, Pampanga.</li>
						<li> In a display of brutality, the Japanese authorities refuse to release Basilio Gomez's remains to the family and threaten them with arrest. </li>
						<li> Faced with danger, Remedios and her entire family relocate from Anao to Tarlac for their safety.</li>
						<li> The loss of her father becomes a driving force for Remedios's determination to seek justice and revenge. </li>
					</ul>

					<div class="divider-2">guerilla involvement</div>
					<ul>
						<li> Eusebio “Bio” Aquino, a friend of her father’s, convinces Remedios Gomez to join the Hukbalahap guerrilla movement to protect herself and her family from the Japanese occupation.</li>
						<li> The guerrilla forces gave Kumander Liwayway her name, meaning "Commander Dawn". </li>
						<li> Her first task was working with the medical team to provide treatment for sick and injured Huks.</li>
						<li> After a few months she received a promotion to be the commander of a new unit, Squadron 3-V, with 200 men.</li>
						<li> She undergoes military training in tactics and strategy at the Guerilla Officers Military Academy (GOMA).</li>
						<li> Under Kumander Liwayway's command, her squadron engages in activities such as stealing, assembling, and repairing firearms, as well as receiving donated weapons from another woman-led squadron in Zambales.</li>
						<li> Kumander Liwayway gained prominence after she and her squadron went head-to-head with the Japanese at the Battle of Kamansi, despite the fact that the lead commander, Kumander Bio, had already ordered for a withdrawal. When reinforcements arrived, they were surprised to see Liwayway and her squadron continuing to battle the combined Japanese and Philippine Constabulary force.</li>
						<li> Liwayway maintained her femininity in the face of adversity. When they confronted her about combining war and vanity, she responded, “Why shouldn’t I? One of the things I am fighting for in this movement is the right to be myself.”</li>
						<li> In 1942, Liwayway had been promoted to squadron commander, who carried out daring ambuscades against enemy troops.</li>
						<li> After the war, she rejoined the Huks, this time in their struggle against the Roxas government.</li>
						<li> Then in 1947 Kumander Liwayway was captured and became an instant media celebrity.</li>
						<li> Liwayway was charged with rebellion, sedition and insurrection.</li>
						<li> She was brought to Malacanang and had the famous “confrontation” with President Manuel Roxas, who accused her of terrorizing people and attempting to overthrow the government.</li>
						<li> She was released after a year upon issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, and the case against her was dismissed when the court declared that she was arrested and detained without preliminary investigation. Liwayway immediately rejoined her HMB comrades.</li>
						<li> In 1948, Kumander Liwayway was married to Banaag Paraiso, a second cousin of the Lavas, a rich land-owning family of Bulacan. The union bore a son, Oscar, named after Liwayway’s fallen brother.</li>
						<li> She and her husband, Bani Paraiso, were sent to the Huk network in Iloilo in 1948. </li>
						<li> The rebel camp was betrayed by a close friend of Paraiso, Fred Gloria, and was raided by a unit of the Philippine Constabulary.</li>
						<li> Liwayway was once again put in prison and allowed later to have her son join her in detention.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div>
					<div class="divider-2">later life</div>
					<ul>
						<li> Upon her release, she and Oscar stayed with relatives and friends, still fearful for their security.</li>
						<li> She then decided to live a civilian life with her son because she did not want her only child to grow up in the mountains, hiding and constantly fearful for their lives.</li>
						<li> When things seemed to be more settled, a sister who had landed a permanent job helped them get a housing unit in Project 4.</li>
						<li> Liwayway, a resourceful woman, started selling vegetables, later acquiring first a market stall and later more stalls which she rented out.</li>
						<li> She supported herself and raised her son and his education until he finished his engineering degree. </li>
						<li> She served in the Executive Committee of the Huk Veterans Organization with Luis Taruc and worked for them to receive pensions as veterans of the Second World War. </li>
						<li> She continued to harbor those who were still on the run, or give money or rice whenever needed.</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="divider-2">death</div>
					<ul>
						<li> In 2014, she died at the age of 95 due to cardiopulmonary arrest.</li>
